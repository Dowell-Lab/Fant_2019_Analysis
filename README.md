# Pausing Meta Analysis

This project provides code used in the analysis of code from Fant 2019
(-- TITLE --). This analysis includes metagene analysis, pause index
analysis, and other miscellaneous analysis performed in the course of
developing this manuscript. Below, I have made a best effort to
describe the methods used in analysis and to group the files based on
the type of analysis that they belong to. If you have any questions
about specific code in this repository, please contact Zachary Maas at
<zama8258@colorado.edu>.

## Basic Project structure

- [src](./src) - scripts developed for data analysis
- [data](./data) - raw data used to perform analysis
- [doc](./doc) - documentation and preliminary reports
