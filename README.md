# Pausing Meta Analysis

This project seeks to explore the methods used for quantifying pausing in nascent sequencing assays. The project uses the data from [Chen's 2015 paper](http://lawsonlab.wustl.edu/files/2015/09/Paf1-Cell-2015.pdf)  on promoter proximal pausing.

## Project structure

- [data](./data) - outside data including hg19 refseq downloaded from the UCSC genome browser. Chen's data is available at [](nascent.colorado.edu)
- [doc](./doc) - documentation and preliminary reports
- [src](./src) - scripts developed for data analysis
